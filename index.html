	<center><h1>The Missing CPPS</h1></center>
	<div class="box1"><p>iWaddle was an AS2/AS3 CPPS (Club Penguin Private Server), created by Lennor that dates back to Febuary, 22, 2018. iWaddle was supposedly a "risen from the dead" version of the original iWaddle (which's domain is now for sale) from years prior.</p></div>
	<div class="box2"><par>iWaddle was shutdown due to lack of development and operation on servers. The servers and domain names for iWaddle were also abandonded due to Lennor not paying for them. It is unclear what happened to Lennor. Lennor disappeared after 4/01.2018, with his last sent message being "I need admins".</par></div>
	<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><center><div class="boxbot"><p>The iWaddle! Discord server has gone mostly inactive. All moderators except for Alan have left, and barely anyone chats. However, SpaceByte and Alan remained in the discord server, occasionally chatting about Lennors disappearence and what has happened since iWaddle's closure. Many theories, idea, and evidence has risen. Some theories of what happened to Lennor include: a fatal injury, which could've caused a coma, or focusing on other things, such as college. Some evidence regarding Lennor's disappearance have been discovered aswell, however, they are not huge leads. Some evidence includes: the Beta discord bot having an about me (which were added in 2021, way after iWaddle's closure). By looking through WhoIs records, SpaceByte discovered the iWaddle.ml domain was purchased early 2018, and expired early 2021, implying Lennor intended to run iWaddle until at least 2021, which could imply there was something stopping Lennor from doing so. Other than that, there is not much evidence or ideas known about what happened to iWaddle, and it remains a mystery today.</p></div></center>
